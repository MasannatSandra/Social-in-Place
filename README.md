# Social-in-Place
Social in Place is a website create by a team of 4 for the Hack-in-Place hackathon. It uses HTML and CSS, which we all learned for the first time during this weekend, to put together a website that contains many fun, free games that require no download which you can enjoy with your friends! It focus on staying connected during the shelter in place rule as many different type of games can be found, from drawing to cards games and starts at only requiring 2 players! Social in Place also uses question to ask then direct the user to games that they may enjoy depending on how they answer the two provided questions.
